## 🔍 If Login Still Fails

### Check 1: Backend Server Running?
**Terminal output should show:**
```
✅ MongoDB Connected Successfully
🚀 Server running on http://localhost:5000
```

If not running:
```powershell
cd e:\testingui\kk2\krishna-care-react\backend
npm run dev
```

### Check 2: Frontend Running?
Check your terminal for the port (usually 3001 or 3003)

If not running:
```powershell
cd e:\testingui\kk2\krishna-care-react
npm run dev
```

### Check 3: Correct Credentials?
- **Email must be exactly:** `admin@krishnacare.com` (all lowercase)
- **Password must be exactly:** `Admin@123` (capital A)
- No extra spaces before or after

### Check 4: Browser Console
1. Press `F12` to open Developer Tools
2. Go to "Console" tab
3. Look for error messages (red text)
4. Common issues:
   - **CORS error:** Backend not running or wrong API URL
   - **Network error:** Backend not accessible
   - **401 Unauthorized:** Wrong credentials

### Check 5: Network Tab
1. Press `F12` → "Network" tab
2. Try to login
3. Look for the login request to `/api/auth/login`
4. Click on it to see:
   - Status code (should be 200 for success)
   - Response body
   - Request body

## 🔄 Reset Password Again (If Needed)

If login still fails, run this script to reset the password:

```powershell
cd e:\testingui\kk2\krishna-care-react\backend
node check-admin.js
```

This will:
- Check if admin user exists
- Reset password to `Admin@123`
- Display the credentials

---

## 🧪 Test API Directly

To verify the backend is working, open browser and go to:
```
http://localhost:5000/api/health
```

You should see: `{"status":"OK","message":"Server is running"}`

## 🆘 Common Error Messages
